summary: "The ChannelsDiffusiveWave component, a part of the spatially
  distributed hydrologic model TopoFlow, uses the <em>diffusive
  wave</em> method to compute flow velocities for all of the channels
  in a D8-based river network. This method is similar to the kinematic
  wave method for modeling flow in open channels, but instead of a
  simple balance between friction and gravity, it includes the
  pressure gradient induced by a water-depth gradient in the
  downstream direction. By using water-surface slope instead of bed
  slope in Manning's equation or in the law of the wall, water can
  move across flat areas that have a bed slope of zero. Local and
  convective accelerations in the momentum equations are still
  neglected, just as in the kinematic wave method."
