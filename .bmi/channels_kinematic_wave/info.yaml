summary: "The ChannelsKinematicWave component, a part of the spatially
  distributed hydrologic model TopoFlow, uses the <em>kinematic
  wave</em> method (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955) for modeling flow in
  open channels. This method combines mass conservation with the
  simplest possible treatment of momentum conservation, namely that
  all terms in the general momentum equation (pressure gradient, local
  acceleration and convective acceleration) are neglible except the
  friction and gravity terms. A flow in which gravitational
  acceleration is exactly balanced by friction is referred to as
  steady, uniform flow. For these flows the water surface slope,
  energy slope, and bed slope are all equal."
