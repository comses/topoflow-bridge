summary: "The DiversionsFractionMethod component is a part of the
  spatially distributed hydrologic model TopoFlow. TopoFlow supports
  three different types of flow diversions: sources, sinks, and
  canals. Sources are point locations, such as natural springs, where
  water enters the watershed. Sinks are point locations where water
  leaves the watershed. Canals are man-made reaches such as tunnels or
  irrigation ditches that transport water from one point to another,
  typically without following the natural gradient of the terrain that
  is indicated by the DEM. The upstream end of a canal is essentially
  a sink and the downstream end a source."
